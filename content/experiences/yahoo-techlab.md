- ***Next Generation Vector Search Engine Platform  Vald  
Founder & Lead Developer (Go/C++/Python/Kubernetes/OpenStack)***	2019/8~present  
I'm working on the development of distributed approximation KNN graph and tree dense-vector search engine for large-scale vector data. Vald enables the similarity search for Yahoo Japan scale data. We use Vald in the recommendation platform, image search, and video analysis and text search by the vector.  
Although we already have the similarity search technology called NGT/ngtd. It only supports running on a single server, and there was a problem that memory and CPU did not scale and was not suitable for distributed cloud environments.  
So, for now, I'm working on developing a distributed dense vector search engine called Vald (Vektor+Wald in german)
