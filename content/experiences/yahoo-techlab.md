- ***Next Generation Vector Search Engine Platform  
Founder & Lead Developer (Go/C++/Pyhton/Kubernetes/OpenStack)***	2019/8~present  
Development of approximate k-nearest-neighbor graph-tree dense vector search engine, that can be used in a wide range of fields such as YahooJAPAN's recommendation and image search and video analysis.  
Although we already have similar technology called NGT/ngtd, but it's only supports running on a single server, and there was a problem that memory and CPU did not scale and was not suitable for distributed cloud environments.  
So for now I'm working on developing distributed dense vector search engine called Vald (Vector+Wald in german)
