Our team has developed a sharing time SNS called “SMILE MILE". “SMILE MILE" is an application that can find people who act with me at events such as Tokyo 2020. Finally, when two people take pictures, we analyze facial images by machine learning & evaluate “degree of smile", and users can stock “smile miles".
